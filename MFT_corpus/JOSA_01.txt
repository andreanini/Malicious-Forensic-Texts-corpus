Instead of huntng Lions in California, let us declare open season
on State SEN TIM LESLIE, his family, everyone he holds near and
dear, the Cattlemen's association and anyone else who feels that LIONS
in California should be killed.

I think it would be great to see ths slimeball, asshole, conservative
moron hunted down and skinned and mounted for our viewing pleasure.

I would rather see every right-wing nut like scumface Leslie destroyed
in the name of politicl sport, then lose one mountain lion whose only
fault is havng to live in a state with a fuck-ed up jerk like this
shit-faced republican and his supporters.

Pray for his death.  Pray for all their deaths.

Lets HUNT Sen. Tim Leslie for sport?
