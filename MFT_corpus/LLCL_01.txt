My Dear Vice President --

I have become very alarmed about the disunity that has become more than just serious --

I am for President Johnson, you and Dean Rusk hundred percent --

You have no idea how this effects me -- Bobby Kennedy is taking advantage of the youth about the Veitnam War -- This borders on treason -- He is using Politicis, and to me he is dangerous and a traitor using his high Position to cover this -- he wants Power & he is selling the U.S. out to get it --

I could go on & on about men like him -- William Fulbright is a more frightful enemy than Ho Chi Minh --

Mr. Vice President I have a Son going to the war zone for the 2nd time -- I have another Son who will enter service soon -- I have a Son in Law in the Service -- I am not going to let men like McCarty, Kennedy, Morse, Martin King, Stokley Carmichael divide this country -- To keep encouraging Hanio -- The idea of Rep. Lester Woff -- bringing up a resolution to repeal the Tonkin Gulf resolution is insane -- this has got to be stopped -- Our boys over there have got to have our full support --

Mr. Vice President have you any idea what it is like to play the game of Russian Roulette? Well that what the Marines at K.S. are doing ever hour of the day -- and they know what they are fighting for -- We need complete victory in Vietnam -- even to the point of invading N. Vietnam --

Fulbright -- Kennedy -- King -- Morse have delayed this victory --

Mr. Vice President I am begging you to help me -- some way legally to shut these men up -- Now! -- I am a ex-Marine -- my passions & emotions are very high in this matter --

I would really feel it a duty to eliminate these men or as many as I could before I was killed -- I believe in this enough to die for my Country --

Respectfully

Lloyd K. Clemens.
