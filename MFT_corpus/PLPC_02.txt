The Progressive Labor Party of Chicago, Illinois is going to kill U.S. Senator Jesse Helms of North carolina. The reason we are going to do this is because the U.S. government has been committing atrocities against the members of the New Jewell Movement in Grenada ever since the United States invasion of Grenada in October, 1983. We are going to wait until Senator Helms visits Boston, Massachusetts. We are going to catch him in the subway station in Boston. A Hispanic member of the Progressive Labor Party will sneak up behind Senator Helms while he is standing on the platform of the subway station waiting for the subway train to arrive. The Hispanic person will suddenly grasp Senator Helms' ankles with his hands and pull backwards. Helms will drop and smash his face hard onto the floor of the subway station. A white man will then quickly quietly kick Senator Helms in the side of his head like it's a football. Then three Chinese members of the Progressive Labor Party will grab Senator Helms and toss him head first off of the platform onto the railway tracks in the subway station just before the subway train rolls past. When the front of the train runs over Jesse Helms it will smash him and squash him and slice him up so that he dies. After the subway train leaves the subway station, then a Black person who is a friend of the Progressive Labor Party will take photographs of Helms's remains to publish in the newspaper, "challenge”. In the meantime the five heros who knocked "scum of the earth" Helms onto the railway tracks will be riding on the train that ran over him and getting off at various stops to make good their escape. They will then go celebrate Helms' death.
