Damn you - even us Democrats, who have worked so hard for the party, are amazed at your ruthlessless, your "politicking", - (sending your wife down to Bedford-Stuvesyant, etc.), the Alaska bit, etc. God, when are you going to learn that some of us do not want this buying of your way into power and the White House, even if your gloamorous name is KENNEDY?

The very name makes use see red - we remember the ruthlessness, the arroganze, your mother boa sting and bragging, all of the trimmings that make our blood simply boil.

And now you don't even stick to your work at Washington, but have begun already to bet your sites (or is it sights) on the Presidency? God, how damnable can you get? Just about as damnable as you Kennedys always are!

I can say right now, you will never live in that White House. Like your two diibolical brothers before you, you will end up on a mound in Arlington Cemetery, and good riddance of all of you! Thank God "the queen" is only another of the Greek gal-friends, instead of sitting on her undeserved pedestal.

Some of us will assure that you will never be President! If Sirhan hadn't gotten Bobby, someone else would have! Believe me! The hate for your Kennedys who try to buy political office the way you buy houses and yachts, is despicable, and you will never, no never, make it to that honored office. By god, some of us have learned well how to SEARCH AND DESTROY, and we are cleaning up our weapons and drawing up strategy, as if you were a Viet-Cong.

EVERY ONE OF YOUR POLITICAL PLOYS sets us off, triggers our intent and WE'LL GET YOU, MAN, WE'LL GET YOU, even if you do PRETEND you are such a Santa Claus to the blacks.
