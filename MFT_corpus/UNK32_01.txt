Evil days are upon us. The movie actor got caught in the heart where he had no pity for anyone but his gangsters too bad about ANONYMISED he is suffering the blunt of the crimes, but the Lord said share danger or your perish in it. He was with the bad gang - Also too bad about the police and the FBI man.

There is another man marked to go - He comes from the state of N.C. - J. H.

Our history books tell us that in olden days the Courts of Europe had a court (fool) jester - well the U.S. has one - The jesters had very little gray matter but they would laugh, juggle, dance, and make their kings happy. That is just what Jesse Helms is doing. Making the movie actor happy to inflict sorrow and suffering on the poor - jester Jesse should watch his step + mouth - Also the pompous nit wit ANONYMISED had better not wear that fur coat. Someday she might receive a pellet in her fanny - a hunter might take her for a bear or a mink - who knows? They will - sincerely
