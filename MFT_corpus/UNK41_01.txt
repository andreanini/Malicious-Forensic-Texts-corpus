My dear Senator:

I hope this reaches you in time. Tonight I leave for Washington with one motive in mind - your assination.

I am a God fearing man, but I find it impossible to let myself stand by while you arrogantly, ignorantly and self-centeredly tear apart those principles of democracy, fair play, and civil liberties which America has treasured for so long.

Perhaps I will be able to re-reason before I arrive; I doubt it. For months this has plagued me. I feel it only fair to warn you.

Hoping you will realize the menace of your ways, I am

MOST SINCERELY YOURS
