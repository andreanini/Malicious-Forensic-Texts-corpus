Dear Sir:

There are only 2 blemishes on your 40-year record with the FBI. 2 men died whose lives you could have saved.

In 1941 Lepke surrendered to you personally on your promise that he would be tried by the U.S. instead, you turned him over to NY and D.A. Dewey whose life Lepke had spared when he ordered Dutch Schultz removed. Dewey sent him to the chair in 1944 as part of his campaign for President.

Lepke's loss was not a great one to the U.S. but in 1963 America lost its greatest leader since for when your Agents bungled the Lee Oswald case, it was a great victory for the Reds.

Oswald's widow has received $60,000 in contributions, a woman who could have saved JFK with one phone call. I certainly hope that you are checking every person - left or right wing - who has seen fit to disgrace our country by sending her money.

They shot the wrong Kennedy, stop letting bobby use the FBI like the Gestapo. John Knight of the Miami Herald can tell you what I mean.

Disappointed.
