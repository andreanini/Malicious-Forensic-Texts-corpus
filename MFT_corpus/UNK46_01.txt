Your suffering has hardly begun. Teddy is next on the Kennedy “hit parade.” And we won't rest til he gets his.

We are sick of the  Kennedy's and all the damn Kennedy crap.

You stole from the church when you managed its affairs then you bought the church in the person of Richard Cardinal Hypocrite.

You were an unethical business robber and crook. You had a movie actress mistress. Your “devoted” wife stayed home only long enough to get pregnant. With your stolen money she tried to buy respectability but she is still shanty dirty Irish.

You thought you could buy the presidency - and did once. America doesn't like or want dynasties. Jack had to die. Bobby had to die. Teddy has to die. 

We hope you live long enough to see total destruction of the Kennedy's and to suffer again and again before you die and go to Hell for all eternity.
