Mr. Kennedy:

I'm most certain of your knowledge of the anti-Kennedy spree swelling the nation, to which my information will prove interesting indeed.

I represent a left-wing orgainization which receives bids from Cosa Nostra, Longshoremen's and Teamsters unions respectively to eliminate those detrimental political figureheads. Teamster's president Kimmy Hoffa and Frank Fitzsimmons were unpleasently disclosed before the Senate Labor Rackets Committee by the counsel directed by Robert Kennedy. A bid authorized by union directors of Council 12 B.S.E.I.U. OF Greater New York and Teamster union officials was brought before our New York Delegatoin to discontinue his political progress. If the senator had lost the race in California, his elimination from the contingency would have been certain. However, he won and had to be stopped.

Presently, a Bostonian financing corporation wishes to eliminate Sen. Edward M. Kennedy from active contingency so that they may post a prospective candidate. A bid has been received for five hundred thousand dollars which is now under deep consideration by our syndicate. The only method of saving your son is by outbidding the proposed deal. We would like one million dollars which will serve as retroactive cash and will outbid the previous attempt. The money should be placed in a modern breifcase and placed behind a telephone pole accross the road from the newly-built home on Pleasent Hill Road in Orange, Connecticut. Our corporation will expect the currency by noon of Thursday, June 20. A guard will be posted to assure of no foul play. The money will most preferably be accepted in fifty dollar bills. Certainly a man with one son left cannot risk or foolishly gamble his life.

Faithfully yours, 

Merilli Association
