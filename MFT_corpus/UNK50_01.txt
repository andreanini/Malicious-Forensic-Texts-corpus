Dear Madame.

We Italian people are very proud, but we also are very revengful, last week your husband insulted us Italian people which we can not tolerate, I myself am dedicating the rest of my life to avenge this insult in the name of Garibaldi, I am ready to die before a firing XXX anytime in exchange for the privilege of plunging my dagger into the heart of President Roosevelt, this I shall accomplish if it is my last act on this earth.

Viva Mussolini
Long Live Italy
Death to F.D.R.
