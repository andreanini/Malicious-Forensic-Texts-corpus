THIS IS A WARNING BESSY BEATTY			FFrom the Bowery

To Adenoids Bessie Beatty:

The Angels will not pass this letter on to you I know.

For a long time now you have been asking all of us to work in essential war industries, asking us not to waste any thing - to save, save, save. BUT what the hell are you doing despite all of your goddam preaching.

To day you are worrying about your taxi cab worrying about getting up early for your new program. Why don't you stay at home nights instead of running around to shows of course they are free to you, books are also free, your salary is great - we can get news of the shows thru news papers and other good radio talks - and go to work part time yourself. Yes you'll say I give teas, etc. I know your gab. Don't we all help in our own way. You are doing for the Goddam English. Wouldn't it be nice if a day ever comes when the Dam Limeys fight their own troubles. What do you say. Why don't you walk these few blocks to a subway at trolley to your broadcasting station instead of riging. You'll say the taxi driver needs money. Let him work in the defense plants that you are boasting about. You only have two hands and you think you can reach more people What tripe - none of us have more than too hands but we labor. You stink.

When your English friends go on the air you give them all the time they want, but not so with any American.

Who do you think you are to judge who are and who aren't Good Working People. Your jealousy sticks out of you through every line of yours.

The next time you decide to use your expression Speaking for ourselves use it in a room by yourself in that way you won't show your goddam giggling, jack assy stupidity.

Your HUSBAND IS SICK NOW I HEARD YOU SAY BUT WATCH OUR FOR YOUR SLEF WE ARE GOING TO WAYLAY YOU BEFORE LONG. WE'LL QUIET THIS SHITTY GODDAM RANTING ON THE RADIO. I HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT A PARTY. THIS IS A WARNING. we also know your address home address. I AM AN AMERICAN AND GOING TO PROTECT IT FOR MY FRIENDS FROM YOU DAM ENGLISH BASTARDS.

A BOWERY BUM
