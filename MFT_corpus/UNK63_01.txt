Dear Mr. Staats:

G. A. O. is much concerned with honesty in reporting contributions to Federal candidates. Some of the taxpayers in Ohio doubt it. Watergate is like an ice cream social as compared to the administration of Gov. John Gilligan of Ohio. They have shaken down more employees and people doing business with state government than has been done anywhere else in America.

The graft is sophisticated; the kickbacks are extortion; the payoffs are a way of life. It is everywhere.

The architects are Gilligan, Dr. Sirik, and four crooked directors, plus a few lawyers who handle graft as fees.

Your organization is supposed to have given Ohio Democrat Headquarters a clean bill of health. If they are clean, then the Watergate boys deserve a medal.

We don't want to get fired or we would sign our names, which would mean automatic exit for us.

Disgusted Democrats, who are sick of graft!!!
