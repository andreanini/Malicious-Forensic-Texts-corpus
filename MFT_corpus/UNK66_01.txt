Lucille Balls:

All you drought stricken snakes listen:

When Wordl War III comes there ain't gonna be any more poor American guys dying for you rich bitches. It will be everyone for themselves, and the sooner God sends devastation to earth, the better!

I served honorably (but stupidly) once in the service of my country, but come next time there ain't gonna be anybody to fight and die for the fatcats and the rich. God will wreak widespread devastation, and no area on earth will be exempt from the fiery burning of God's wrath. Then all you rich snakes will fight and die for yourselves--no innocent, stupid serving youth will die for you.

May the drought continue until all you snakes are forced out of the west and your rich homes, until you lose millions.

I know that the rich don't care for the poor because I have written to several rich snakes, and they didn't even answer. Well, your day will come!

That flunky singer-actor missed death in the Beverly Hills Supper Club, Southgate, Kentucky, and when the earthquake hits L.A., I will be scouring the obituaries, expectantly to see your name on it.

If you were burning to death, I wouldn't spit or piss on you to quench the flames.

All there is is war, hate, kill, friction, murder, and pressure.
