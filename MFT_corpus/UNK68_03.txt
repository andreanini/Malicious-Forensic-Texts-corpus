J. C. - Greenville terrors - N.J.

Look Rocky, the threat still goes If Phila don't do the job - we will and with pleasure - 
You may think this is a joke but its ANONYMISED we want - and your daughter - She-better-not-be-to-the-fights-and-you-win- 
So dump the bout with Ezzard Charles or lose your ugly fat family. 
Remember we will be at the fight along with Newark boys with our zip guns. 
Laugh if you want but its ANONYMISED life-we want -
and tell weill he had better watch his step also -or he better not go at 1579 Broadway anymore in New York City. We hate your guts you-wop-. 

Remember Rocky-dump or (die).
