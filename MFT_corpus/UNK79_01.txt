Walter Winchell -

Your remarks regarding Queen Elena of Italy unwarranted and base. She is a great and charitable lady and has always been kind to her people - especially xxx including Jews. Surely, decent Americans will not refuse charity to Italian people. Only sheenies and kikes who are ashamed of their race, like Lipshitz who has become Winchell, and thinks he can get away with it. Many of my friends no longer come to stork club so as not to meet same sort of kike scum who go to Reubens on 58 st. As a white ANONYMISED ought to know better than to have such a heel as you are in his club. MENAI MENAI
