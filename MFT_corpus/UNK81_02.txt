To the Daily News:

I hope you receive this letter in good health and in good Spirits:

To confirm our telephone conversation last night: Im writing to inform you that I decided to use the governments chain of command to resolve my problem: My problem? After close to two years of searching for the truth, and a life time of mistreatment, I have not received any acknowledgment. For the last 14 months I haven't had sexual intercourse, calling myself being faithful to ANONYMISED, my best friends and relatives constantly challenge my sanity. And all I ask is that ANONYMISED tell me yes or no, either she wants me as her husband or not. but I will not accept that she is too important or too busy to answer me considering how this all has affected my life.

So I decided to go to the FBI today, if that doesn't work ill go to the CIA, military intelligents, or up to the office of the President of the United States of America, and if the chain of command doesn't work I will resort to violence, to bring attention to my problem. I'll commit mass murder at a Michael Jackson concert if necessary. In an attempt to murder Micheal, then you will have to deal with my situation in the public eye.

Now the issue with ANONYMISED is love -vs- being used with Micheal Jackson and John Gotti its about financial compensation. I told you what will happen to John if he doesn't pay up Micheal I will personally attempt to kill if he doesn't pay me my money. If im crazy ill go to jail, if not then everybody will know the truth.
"But I can't live like this any longer."

Sincerely

ANONYMISED
