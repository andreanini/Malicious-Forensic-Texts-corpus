Dear ANONYMISED,

I hope you receive this letter in good health and in good spirits:

I know I said I wouldn't fax anymore, but I just spoke to my brother inlaw and he told me about your call, and this is important for you to understand.

I just came back from the FBI at 26 Federal Plaza, and I handed over a 91 page document, plus the two pages I faxed this morning.

Now if you want information or have information you can call the FBI at (212) 225-2700. I expect to hear from them on wednesday.

Now trust me on this ANONYMISED the only way out for the Jackson Family is through me, you can't get security to protect them from me, because im responsible for their security.

My interest is that half of Micheal's estate is mines, my proof is if he doesn't pay up im going after him.

They controlled me because of my love for ANONYMISED now if ANONYMISED leaves me, not only will she be a broke bitch by my doing, but the Mafia will kill her, because she was unfaithful and they have no more use for her. If she accepts me she will be protected, because they can not bring harm to my wife, because if they play killing wife games, they must remember that, ("I hate to say it, but it's true") im the number one killer, but hey, for the most part I did it for the government, that's why I was granted legal immunity. As for why didn't anybody know? (Read:MK:6:4-6) My sister is also confussed.

For the Jackson Family, I will protect them even if it means killing them.

ANONYMISED I owe you $1M for what you did. (Thanks)"
