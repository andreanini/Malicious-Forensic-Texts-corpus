You simply can’t win this fight because you are on the wrong side of the argument. So stop pushing people around here.

Cease all your activities and remove all your installations. Return the land to what it was before you came, every last bit of it ,including your fancy gas plant at Kelly Lake before things get a lot worse for you and your terrorist pals in the oil and gas business. Use your excessive earnings to install green energy alternatives instead. That can be negotiated here but there will be no negotiation with you on fossil fuel activities. FULL STOP!!

You have 3 months to convince the residents here and the general public that you will commit to this program meaning that all actions against you will cease for three months from the time of this note. We can all take a summer vacation including your security personnel and the RCMP who have not helped you to date anyway – which was the whole point of the six minor and fully controlled explosions: to let you know that you are indeed vulnerable, can be rendered helpless despite your megafunds, your political influence, craftiness, and deceit in which you trusted.

Don’t press the issue in your pride and greed and force worse things to happen. In the meantime, give the people here room during these three months to talk about these problems unmolested by any further interrogations and/or investigations so that they can speak their minds without reprisal.

You have 5 years to shut down and remove all the oil and gas facilities you have established over the last 8 years in our territories of the Tomslake and Kelly Lake districts. Don’t Delay!!
