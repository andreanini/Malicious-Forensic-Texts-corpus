Don't extrapolate. Your attacks will come to an end. And the hundreds of emails we collected that you wrote about so many people you claim are your twitter friends and the phone calls we all taped with you will reveal your true colors. So blog away because I can see that when we post everything you'll have a hard time keeping those followers.

Remember that time you met ANONYMISED and introduced yourself as "shoq?" Well, everyone, ANONYMISED included, thinks you were a prick and no one was impressed by you. When you left they all talked about you and believe me it wasn't flattering.

Oh and Ana Marie Cox had a mouthful to say about you!

The jig is up. You can try to rally people to "your side" but you're better off keeping your head down.

What's amazing is that all of the women who encountered you have the same story to tell about your bullying. So we started taping your calls and Skype chats a year ago.

Some of us are your best friends on twitter
