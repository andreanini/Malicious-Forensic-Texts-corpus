Baseer Naveed;- You are indeed an established bastard who is ridiculing Pakistan while seated with English bastards of Chinese origin; can you or other minions like you could ever question the creation of the state of Hong Kong ; if you are damn opposed to the religion of Islam who stops you to become a Christian or a follower of the Buddhism; I wish Hong Kong could invent a time machine and take you to the past where you could marry your mother with an English man and then you could take rebirth as a Douglass, David or Jacob; while reliant on the charities of the anti Islam forces third rated minions like you cannot challenge the ideology of this country and indeed you are to be punished one day for having breached our patriotic sentiments or God willing I would locate you one day and teach you such a terrible lesson on abusing our motherland that dwellers of Hong Kong would remember it for long.
