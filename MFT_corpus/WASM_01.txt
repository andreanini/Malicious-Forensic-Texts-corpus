Sir: I grew up in N.C., still have many friends there. It is, however, most unfortunate that you were elected as a Senator from N.C. You are, unquestionably, the worst Senator ever elected by N.C.

Thank God, however, the tide is turning. With the help of distingueshed Senators like Bob Packwood of Oregon or Goldwater of Arizona, not to mention Lowell Weicky of Comm., You are being revealed as the #1 scoundrel of all times.

I wish someone could could push you down some stairs and break your neck.
