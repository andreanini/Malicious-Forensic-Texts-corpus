The Progressive Labor Party of Chicago, Illinois is going to set off a bomb inside of the Adams Mark Hotel in downtown St. Louis, Missouri and kill everybody in it to protest the United States invasion of Grenada five years ago. The Progressive Labor Party is in solidarity with the 100 Cuban construction workers who were defending the airport in Grenada when the United States attacked that country. The United States imperialists did something wrong when they invaded Grenada
