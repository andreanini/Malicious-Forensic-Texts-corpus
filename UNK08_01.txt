YOU ARE MINE. MAINLY BECAUSE I WONT LET YOU GO. BUT I WILL HAVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT I HAVE TO DO - YOU ARE MINE. YOU ONLY DANCE FOR ME. ONLY ME. SOON I WILL HAVE INGREDIANTS TO CAST A SPELL ON YOU. I MUST BE PATIENT. YOU MAY NOT HEAR FROM ME FOR AWHILE BUT DON'T WORRY. I WILL BE WATCHING YOU. PROTECTING YOU FROM EVIL. YOU WON'T BE LONELY WILL YOU. I WILL SEE YOU DANCE SOON. AND I WILL HAVE THE BEST SEAT IN THE HOUSE. IF YOU ONLY KNEW HOW CLOSE I'LL BE. I LOVE YOU.
