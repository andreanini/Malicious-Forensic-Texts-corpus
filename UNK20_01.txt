Ted Kennedy - 

Everyday I become more aware of the fact that you are not a true Catholic but use the Church -- Your ideas are truly Communistic -- You use the Church as a cloak -- as did Jack & Bobbie.

Behold the enclosed picture you posed for, for the Nat. Communist paper! No other news paper had this picture. You are working for the votes of Blacks just as your brothers did -- But not one Kennedy would live even hundreds of yards near one -- Such hypocrites!

Your brother John was elected bec. he had M.L. K. the Communist freed from jail. Your brother Bobbie had the army put it to allow one Negro to enter Miss U - That man, John, is now immensely wealthy even tho he never worked to earn a dollar -- How did he get this wealth? How did M.L.K. get his wealth? Do you care? No - as long as you get the votes of Blacks --

John now owns an apt. house he paid almost $300000 for - He rented an expensive apt. here as soon as he left Miss. U and went to Columbia -- Do you care? No.

Ted Kennedy -- read the other article I enclose thats with that outragious picture of your brother Bobbie with Chavez who used the Church as a cloak - who went to Mass every morning and mid. Holy Communion as a fake -- may the Divil take him! And read what one Church thinks of him and your brother Bobbie is with him! Ye Gods! Has no Kennedy any honor? Your big mouth against every anti-Communist -- you were against Otepha - why? Afraid some of your pals may be exposed? Well, God will take over and I hope if you don't mend your ways will go as your brother did.
