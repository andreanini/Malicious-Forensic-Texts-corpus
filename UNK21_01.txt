This is not a joke. It's serious. There has been so much talk and wondering why Kennedy was killed I want people to know why Johnson gets it. I lost a son and daughter in Roosevelt's World War II, my friend lost two sons. I lost a grandson in Truman’s Korean War, my friend lost a son in Kennedy's Bay of Pigs. We each have grandsons in Viet Nam war. Expect to hear any time that some of them have been killed.
All these wars was unnecessary and the billions of dollars spent and given away was wasted. If the fool presidents had not given other countries money they would not have been able to make war. Wars go on and always will as long as they get free money.
We are two old men who have nothing to live for. Our only aim is to stop this fool Johnson and Humphrey. We have followed them all over - not to adore them but to see how easy it will be to kill them. There is no problem to that. We have seen many chances. Kennedy was right when he said if somebody wanted to kill a president they could regardless of safety measures and guards. We have been following ever since they were nominated. Have lost a few days because I got the dam virus but we are on our way again. It won't be long now if it turns out as most are expecting. Of course we will be killed it his comes off but thats ok we are both old and sick and nothing to live for. This will be the last thing we can do to help save this country and the men and money. This is irony. We have been Democrats. I have the same name as one.
