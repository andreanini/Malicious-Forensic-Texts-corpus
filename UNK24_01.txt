MORSE FOR PRESIDENT!! FEARLESS, FAITHFUL MORSE!! Back in '52 Eisenhower was no sooner "elected" than W M instantly said "he feeled The People to win his election"!! NOW the same fearless, faithful MORSE say Eisenhower is forgoing an "economic fascism" against The People - the depravity of one performance in the depravity of the other!! Fooling The People to forge fascism against them is the very pattern of Adolph & Benito all over again but badfaith against The People is not the American Way of Life!! Guile with a grin is no qualification for President of these United States & THE AMERICAN PEOPLE will not be mocked by any such badfaith!!Heuberger's LARCENT AT HELLS CANYON cries aloud for MORSE at that CANYON & in our White Hourse!!! This "hero" with a grin, in all his guile, has a healthy fear of MORSE whose stride & stature, character & integrity, stamina & goodfaith are AMERICAN to the core!! VOTERS will go for MORSE with thundering shout of joy & make Gettysburg a last retreat for guile & badfaith!!!
SIC SEMPER!!! MORSE FOR PRESIDENT!!!
