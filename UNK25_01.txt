Dear Sir:

As God had decreed that the Holy United States should NEVER lose a victory in war, and as you have betrayed "The Power of God" working in behalf of His chosen United States in your giving away the American vicotry to the atheistic Soviets, you therefore became a TRAITOR before God, and against the Holy heritage which He gave to the American people.

Therefore I say to you, in God's Holy Name, that you shall in NO wise be elected president of this Holy nation.

The leadership of the Republican party has rejected the Divine Plan for our nation, and God has again rejected the Republican party.

It is therefore Spiritually impossible for you to become President of the United States.


"This know also, that in the LAST days (of this Christian age) perilous times shall come.

"For men shall be lovers of their own selves ('me-firsters').

"Traitors, heady, high-minded,

"Having a FORM of godliness, but DENYING the POWER thereof."
2nd Timothy - 3rd chapter.


Ther Republicans have "denied the Power of God" working in American politics.

Governor Stevenson had nothing to do with the policies which has brought our nation into judgement before God, therefore he shall be elected president, the LAST President of this age.
