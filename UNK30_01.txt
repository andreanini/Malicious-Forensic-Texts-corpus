Dear Senator Helms,
or to whoever reads this letter first.
Inform everyone who are national senators and representatives and say or show this letter amonge them.

A desolation has been decreed upon the nation and upon those in the nation. If I do not receive $25,000 dollars in cashiers checks at $25 each these things shall take place.

The two wings of the capital building shall crumble to the ground. It will happen in this manner.

Twenty four hours after this letter is read by anyone the walls of the two wings shall being to shake and will shake for 30 minutes. At the end of thirty minutes the walls will slowly give way allowing any and all who are in there to flee. The crumbling will last for 30 minutes and at the end of the 30 minutes period all of the two wings of the capital shall be crumbled to the ground.

The part that holds the dome shall not be harmed, just the outer wings.

I will deal with the SBI official here in Murfreesboro N.C.
