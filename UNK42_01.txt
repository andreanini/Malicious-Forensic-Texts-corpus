Dear Mr. Hoover:

I am no Govt. employee who puts loyalty to Sen. McCarthy first. But I say this:
It is well known that Cohn & Schine are homosexuals. It is assumed by many that McCarthy himself is also a fairy.

Trust you will put this "derogatory" report in their files.

They are the 3 dirtiest men in U.S. today.
