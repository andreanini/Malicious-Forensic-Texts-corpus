Thomas Kilby - Sir

I want to inform you that if Henry Ford doesent get Muscle Shoals plant to run for the benefit of the South and the working class of people within the next 30 days that I will kill you, and 3 more of the working people friend will kill Senator Norris and F. E. Engstrum for interfering with the power house. It was done to prevent Henry Ford from helping out the South and to take the idle plant off of the people and put it in operation for the intrust of the farmer to finish the dam and operate the plant be more benifitchal to people than for the Ala Power Co to have the power house alone It would give more men work and help out the South. I am a Southern man and I have decided that such men as you all that oposed to the Ford offer the whole U. S. A. would be better off without you all. Myself and two others are to do the work for you all. Now we are B. S. The time has come when something has got to be done.  It is imposible for you all to get by without death.  Your gards or any protection you have cant stop us for they are 1000 of ways to get you all.  Such as posining or shooting from up stairs windows or booming your residents and a number of other ways to do the work.  Hoping for the benefit of you mens family you will change your minds and do what you can for H. Ford to buy or lease the plant
