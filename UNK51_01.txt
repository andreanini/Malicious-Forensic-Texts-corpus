Chief of Police

Dear Sir:-

This is to notify you that if Mrs. ELEANOR ROOSEVELT is permitted to speak tonight at the Philharmonic Auditorium, she will be shot to death on the speaker’s platform as a traitor to our country.

The time has come to destroy the warmongers in Washington, and restore our country to a policy of peace, and to stop us from plunging into war and ruin.

We the people Want Peace.

Signed
America First Committee.
