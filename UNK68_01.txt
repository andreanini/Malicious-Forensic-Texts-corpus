Another reminder-either let EZ CHARLES beat you in that June XXX fight or your wife and child get bumped off. We're very familiar with the city of Brockton and the entire surrounding area. If you think that it is worth the lives of your loved ones to win an old boxing watch, go ahead. If you do you'll regret it for the rest of your life. You're guaranteed a return in 90 days, ain't you? Why be so foolish as to ignore this threat on your loved ones' lives. Play ball with us; you can take care of CHARLES in the return match.
