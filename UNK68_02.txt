Listen Cocky Rocky,

We mean business. We've decided to bet out life savings on the impossible, Lz Charles to defeat you for the title in June. We aren't that dumb that we don't realize that's impossible - for that washed up bum to lick you, that is unless we receive a little cooperation from you. Either you lose that fight, we don't care how - decision or KO - or we will bump off your wife and little child. To repeat we don't care how you lose, just lose. If you fail to obey us and win the fight, it's curtains for your wife, and child and not necessarily right after the fight or even months after. We're willing to wait as long as we have to should there be a guard around them. We'll get them sooner or later. You can bet on that.

Desperate Duo

P.S.

We're sending you this note early. You've got loads of time, over 3 months, to think it over. If you're smart you'd better heed us. A little old boxing match ain't worth risking your loved ones lives over. You can get the title back again. He's bound to give you a return fight in 90 days. We promise that we won't send you any letter of threat before that fight.
