Dear Sirs:



With the capture of the 8 spies on our Atlantic border and the disclosures of their plans to destroy our inland plants of war munitions, I recall an incident which I think should be mentioned to you. It may have no importance, and again it might be worth bear in mind.



I was among the thousands present in Soldier Field during the grand turnout in honor of Sen. MacArthur a few Sundays ago. In the course of the program, Bob Hope introduced Miss Marlene Dietrich, who I believe is a German born actress and only recently received her citizenship. The point that struck me so strongly was her repeated statement - when asked about her war-bond selling tour around the country - that the Allis Chalmer plant in Milwaukee was the most interesting. it was so big - so grand - in fact the biggest war production plant in the USA if we ever had the chance, we should see if it was so big - the biggest war plant in the country. of course the above are perhaps not her exact words, but the XXX she dwell upon Allis Chalmers importance to the country and to war, and the fact that she was broadcasting to all parts of the country - and beyond made me wonder if the incident should not be called to your attention Perhaps Miss Dietrich noble job to all possibilities. Frankly I was somewhat surprised that a German born person was chosen and permitted to tour our munition factories at this time. After seeing the movie "International Lady" and reading the accounts of the Atlantic border spies, I'm beginning to lose confidence in our German bretheren.



As my identity is of no consequence, I beg to remain simply as
