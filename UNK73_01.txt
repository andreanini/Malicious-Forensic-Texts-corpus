Dear Sir:-

Our organization is very sorry to hear of your arrest for your brave stand against F.D.R. and his war policies, you must now consider yourself a political prisoner for the duration of this war, and for your own benefit the less you say from now on the better it will be for you, you did your patriotic duty to try to save our country from entering a disastrous war, now sit back and relax and we will continue the fight where you left off, we have been organizing secretly for a long time and are pretty well armed and prepared for action to rid our country of F.D.R. and his clique once and for all.

We admit the Japs did give us quite a surprise at Pearl Harbor, but that surprise is nothing to the surprise we have in store for F.D.R. and his clique of international bankers in Wash. D.C., we will strike when they least expect and after we are through cleaning house in Wash. D.C., this country will be at peace with the rest of the World forever.

So just relax fellow patriot and look toward the future, which will bring our country peace and prosperity forever.

God Bless us in our fight for freedom from F.D.R. and all that he and his clique stand for.

America first and forever.

The People Army of Freedom.
