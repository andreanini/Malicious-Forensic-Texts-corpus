Dear Mr. Winchell:

Please investigate the following case of draft Board No. 9, In Campbell, Ohio:

ANONYMISED who lives at ANONYMISED Campbell, Ohio was supposed to be in the Army two years ago this month. He is 23 years old, and doesn't have an essential job. He is a machinist's helper. Any man over the Draft age or even a lady can do that type of work. He is single and doesn't have any dependents. His father and sister are both working.

He has many of this father's friends working on the Draft Board. There have been many complaints concerning his being defferred for the past two years. I do hope that you will do something about this. It didn't do any good telling any of his friends or politicians that are on this Draft Board.

There have been many married men with dependents that have gone to the army from that Board.

I listen to your program every week ,and trust that you will look into this matter. Thank you.

A citizen.
