To all concerned parties; 

I hope you receive this letter in good health and in good Spirits:

I decided that because nobody is taking me serious, and I can't handle my state of mind, that I am going to Washington D.C. to threaten to kill the President of the United States, George Bush.

If they do not arrest me or solve my problem im gonna attempt to kill President George Bush.

No answer from ANONYMISED is the only wrong answer and I will not accept it. I would be a fool to try to harm her. She isn't my enemy it's the people inbetween me and her.

Sincerely with love

ANONYMISED

P.S. I dear you to call this a bluff.
