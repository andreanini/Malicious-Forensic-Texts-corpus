To Frank Sinatra:

You will arrange a well publicized press-conference not later than August 15, 1979. You will denounce your good friend Spiro Agnew because he sold himself to the Arabs in order to be their spokesman XXX official anti-Israeli and anti-Semitic propagandist in the USA.

If you do not comply this demand your life is NOT in danger. Death is not a punishment, it is a sudden end of life without suffering. Your famous Blue Eyes are in jeopardy.

Study the method of African Bushmen's blowing tubes. The prickle can be targeted very exactly from a distance of 100 feet or further. The tube could be a cigarette holder, could be a part of a photo camera, a binocular, a trompet or a dozen of other objects. It is absolutely undetectable.

No poison will be used but a chemically treated prickle perforates one of your eyes and a sympathetic ophtalmia follows. Consult your doctor, he will convince you.

Think about it which is better: keep the friendship of Agnew or spend the rest of your life in complete darkness.
