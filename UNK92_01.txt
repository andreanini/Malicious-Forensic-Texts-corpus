Your establishment has been targeted. I have in my possession approximately 67 grams of ricin with which I will indiscriminately target at least five of your clients. No doubt, the authorities will be able to trace all of the dead to a total of 11 locations in the Capitol Hill vicinity. Each location will have at least five targets.

Given the amount of exposure, I expect them to die painfully while in hospital. Doctors will initially mistake the symptoms for violent stomach flu; but organ failure occurring so quickly will make them think otherwise. Naturally, there is no antidote, no salve for their unimaginable pain. All I can say is the targets won't care much that they'll be dead and nearly frozen, just as, presumably, they didn't care that they were living...

This is merely your warning for which you can do nothing to prevent me - I have always had time on my side.
